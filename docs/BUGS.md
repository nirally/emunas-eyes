### BUG-001 — Launch via Steam sometimes doesn't start the game
Status: open (not a mod bug) | Severity: 4 | Stage: 0 | Reported: agent, 2026-10-13
Repro: close the game, relaunch from Steam within ~1 minute.
Expected: game starts. Actual: EA app wasn't running; nothing launched for 4 minutes. A second launch worked.
Evidence: process watch 01:10 — EADesktop only appeared on the second launch.
Hypothesis: the EA app shuts down with the game and the next Steam launch races its startup. Happens with or without the mod.
Workaround: launch again.
