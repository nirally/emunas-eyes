# Decisions (append-only)

### D-000 — Target the Steam copy only
Date: 2026-10-13  Stage: setup
Chose: build and test against `E:\SteamLibrary\...\Mirrors Edge Catalyst` (exe 1.0.3.47248).
Rejected: the DRM-removed copy in `E:\Games\`. We don't work on circumvented builds, and other users will have the Steam version.
Rule: never modify, bypass or work around Denuvo, the license token or the EA login.

### D-001 — Prior work survey (choice pending, see Q-002)
Date: 2026-10-13  Stage: setup

| Candidate | Provides | License | Status | Usable how |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BF2VR (Battlefront II) | Frostbite camera via RenderView, alternate-eye stereo, OpenXR, ViGEm input | GPL-3.0 | Archived Nov 2023, different game | Study approach. Code reuse would force our mod to be GPL-3 |
| OpenGameCamera | Frostbite SDK classes, DebugRenderer hooks, MinHook/vtable helpers | MIT | Active-ish, targets SWBF2 | Vendor small helpers with attribution |
| Frosty Tool Suite / Mod Manager | Data edits (camera rig, character, UI assets) | Open source (tool only) | Maintained, supports Catalyst | Use as a tool. Ship `.fbmod` files for data changes |
| Camera On Head (Nexus #332) | Shows which camera data fields exist | Unstated | 2025 | Study only (approach, not files) |
| Helix 3D Vision fix | Map of shaders broken in stereo | Unstated | 2018 | Study only |
| VorpX | Fake 3D | Commercial | — | Not applicable |

No maintained VR framework exists for Frostbite, and no VR mod exists for Catalyst, so "build on top" isn't available.
Recommendation: **hybrid**. Our own native DLL (D3D11 stereo, OpenXR via SteamVR, camera, input), vendoring only MIT-licensed helpers, plus Frosty `.fbmod` data edits for camera-rig and HUD tweaks.

### D-002 — Build path: hybrid
Date: 2026-10-13  Stage: setup
Chose: hybrid. Our own native DLL for stereo, camera, OpenXR and input; vendor only MIT/permissive helpers with attribution; use Frosty `.fbmod` data edits for camera-rig and HUD data.
Rejected: build-on-top (no framework exists); pure from-scratch (no benefit over hybrid).
Note: no GPL-3 code from BF2VR is vendored unless we deliberately choose to license the mod GPL-3.

### D-003 — No teleport locomotion
Date: 2026-10-13  Stage: planning
Chose: smooth locomotion only. Teleport is listed as a known gap.
Reason: Catalyst's movement is momentum-based parkour (wall-runs, vaults and jumps depend on speed). Teleport would bypass the game's movement model and break traversal. The user prefers smooth locomotion anyway.
Cost: users who need teleport for comfort get the vignette and per-move fades instead.

### D-004 — Comfort defaults adjusted to the user
Date: 2026-10-13  Stage: planning
Chose: smooth turn on by default, snap turn available but off; vignette on at low strength (0.3).
Rejected: the standard comfort-first default (snap turn, medium vignette). The user says they love smooth locomotion and hate snap.
Revisit: at packaging (Stage 10), reconsider shipping defaults for new VR users. The user's own profile keeps these.

### D-005 — Entry: NvCameraSDK64.dll proxy (rung 3)
Date: 2026-10-13  Stage: 0
Chose: replace the game's NvCameraSDK64.dll (NVIDIA Ansel SDK library, in the game folder) with our proxy. The original moves to `mecvr\NvCameraSDK64_orig.dll`, and all 9 exports forward through counting stubs.
Rejected: version.dll proxy (H1). Tested: the game loaded System32\version.dll and ignored ours; the launcher layer restricts system-DLL search to System32, so dinput8/winmm/dxgi proxies would fail the same way. General injector (rung 4): not needed.
Bonus: the Ansel interface (updateCamera / setUpdateCameraFunc) is a candidate camera hook for Stage 1.
Cost: we replace one game file. The installer keeps the original; undeploy restores it byte-identical (verified by hash). Steam Verify also restores it.
DRM: untouched. We don't modify the exe, Activation64 or Denuvo.

### D-006 — Save backup declined
Date: 2026-10-13  Stage: prerequisites
The user chose to skip the save backup. Risk accepted. Re-offer before Stage 1 writes to camera/player state.
